version 0.8.0 2008-11-25

- HTB priorities behaviour fixed (magic-priorities keyword is now obsolete)
- prometheus now requires -r ("run") switch to start shaping, default is no action
- C<<1 dialect upgraded to 0.6.2 (for_each() { } instead of every() { }, etc.)
- several minor changesets at https://dev.arachne.cz/svn/prometheus/timeline

version 0.8.0 2008-09-05

- integrated monthly and yearly summary of traffic logs into prometheus script
- bugfix in changeset 75 - 91

version 0.7.8 2008-02-02 (xChaos)

- improved Enterprise Research and Planning (ERP) section
- added informational messages before running iptables-restore
- fixed behaviour of "...-magic-relative-prio 0" + "...-fixed-fixed-prio 0"
- "filter-type classify" prometheus.conf keyword tested in production enviroment
- log file /var/log/prometheus renamed to /var/log/prometheuslog
- credit file /var/run/prometheus.credit moved to  /var/lib/misc

version 0.7.7 2008-01-??

- testing version, 0.8 will be stable release
- faster startup times using iptables-restore (credit: Martin "Ludva" Svoboda)
- compiles and runs correctly on both 32bit and 64bit platforms

version 0.7 2007-01-29

- There were good reasons to rename iptables hashing to iptables indexing.
  Hashing is different algorithm, which offers constant complexity 
  independent on number of hashed entries and high memory requirements, while 
  iptables indexing used in Prometheus offers log8(N) complexity and relatively
  low memory requirements compared to hashing. 
- Multiple keywords can be defined and used in /etc/hosts-like nodelist,
  which allows definition of various data limits for different users or
  definition of both symetrical and asymetrical virtual lines in same config.
- Following prometheus.conf variables were made keyword-dependent:
  KEYWORD-magic-relative-limit, KEYWORD-magic-relative-prio,
  KEYWORD-magic-fixed-limit, KEYWORD-magic-fixed-prio, KEYWORD-,
- Following new prometheus.conf keyword-dependent variables were added:
  KEYWORD-html-color
- Following prometheus.conf variables were removed as obsolete and confusing:
  htb-ceil-bonus-divide, htb-ceil-divide

version 0.6 2006-06-29

- Hyper-optimized iptables hashing (automatic, but compile-time configurable)
- Option hashtable-treshold was made now obsolete
- No "Proxy" column in statistics when qos-proxy-enable is set to 0
- iptables verbose output parsing was rewritten
- Unfinished implementation of some pps limiting and soft-restart related code
- Maybe I have changed something else too, but it was long time since last release

version 0.5.3 2005-08-15

- Predictable error messages generated by tc and iptables were
  redirected to /dev/null
- magic-fixed-prio and magic-relative-prio can be used even with
  magic-fixed-limit and magic-relative-limit set to 0
- Minor bugs in data initializtion were fixed, so program should 
  compile and run also on exotic non-X86 plaforms like BusyBox Linux

version 0.5.2 2005-06-19

- Fixed long integer traffic counter overflow at 4 gigabytes (up or down)
- Fixed incorrect inclusion of http proxy traffic in direct traffic
- Fixed incorrectly displayed parameters of asymetrical upload (Jakub Walczak)
- Dry run (-d switch) output beautification
- Added check if minimum data transfer value is greater then 0 kbps
- magic-priorities added, allows better soft-shaping wihtout reducing HTB ceil

version 0.5.1 2005-03-22

- Fixed serious bug in 0.5 release

version 0.5 2005-03-21

- Better compatibility with up-to-date gcc and new HTB in 2.6.x kernel
- Enterprise Research and Planning (ERP) analysis implemented
- Credit file support implemented (for use with magic-relative-limit)
- magic-relative-limit-4prio now allows softer FUP using HTB prio
- digital-divide-weirdness-ratio added, only tested value is "2"
- qos-leaf-discipline and other new prometheus.conf keywords added

version 0.4 2004-11-02

- HTTP proxy traffic accounting bug fixed (occured with hashed iptables)
- free bandwith traffic shaping (allowed unlimited upload with hashing)
- maximal guaranted speed increased to 2048 kbps (just tc namespace problem)
  (Read: it seems that maximum index of tc classes is restricted to 10000)
- qos-proxy-ip can be inside qos-free-zone even if qos-proxy-enable 
  (Read: Single machine can run NAT/firewall, HTTP proxy and Prometheus QoS)
- command line argument -n (no delay) overrides qos-free-delay keyword
  (Read: Separate configuration file for first run and daily run is not needed)
- traffic from unregistered IPs is monitored even with hashing enabled

version 0.3 2004-10-13

- massive performance improvement thanks to hashing of iptables
- hashtables for /24 subnets are forced if there are 256+ traffic classes
- hashtables can be forced using new option hashtable-treshold)
- qos-free-zone is now optional (use qos-free-zone 0)
- minor bug fix: -h command line arugment now overrides config file

version 0.2 2004-09-20

- daily logging of data transfered in individual traffic classes
- preview feature (create HTML hall of fame without reseting counters) 
- delay feature (useful for creating QoS-free period without reseting counters)
- <A NAME=""> anchors with hostnames of individual traffic classes
- tested succesfuly on our upgraded 10Mbps-full duplex, <1000 packets/sec

version 0.1 

- initial release
- tested succesfuly on our 3Mbps-full duplex line
