# use TABs to separate IP address, hostname, and speed definition!
# this file is just dummy example not related to prometheus.conf.SAMPLE
# see sample-configuration/hosts to learn more about what Prometheus QoS can handle

# syntax: "via-prometheus-MIN-MAX", where MIN and MAX are values in kbps
#         "sharing-HOSTNAME" is useful to aggregate more IPs in single traffic class

# note, that keywords parsed by Prometheus QoS look like ordinary comments to tools 
# used to process bsd-style /etc/hosts file...
