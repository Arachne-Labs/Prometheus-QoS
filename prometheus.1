prometheus \- Traffic shaper replacement for Internet Service Providers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ll +8
.B prometheus
.RB [ " \-dfnpv9 " ]
.RB [ " \-c\ filename " ]
.RB [ " \-h\ filename " ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Prometheus QoS generates multiple nested HTB tc classes with various
rate and ceil values, and implements optional daily traffic quotas and
data transfer statistics (as HTML). It is compatible with NAT, both
asymetrical and symetrical, yet still provides good two-way shaping
and prioritizing, both upload and download.

.SH KNOWN BUGS
Prometheus is slow. This will be changed as soon as the new
iptables-save/load mechanism makes it into stable release.
Future implementation may call netfilter directly via libiptables.
