Prometheus QoS installation - canonical

1. run "./check-kernel-qos" script to check kernel modules HTB and SFQ (optional)
2. as a root, run "make install" (you shouldn't get errors...)
3. edit /etc/prometheus/prometheus.conf (conf/prometheus.conf or sample-configuration/)
4. edit /etc/prometheus/hosts (conf/prometheus.hosts or sample-configuration/)
5. edit /etc/cron.d/prometheus to update preview, shutdown and reload times
6. run "/etc/init.d/prometheus start" to activate QoS
7. run "/etc/init.d/prometheus stop" to shutdown QoS and generate stats
8. run "/etc/init.d/prometheus kill" to force immediate flush of QoS rules
9. setup /etc/init.d/prometheus to your system init (distribution dependent)

Prometheus QoS installation - alternative, old way

1. if can read read this, you have already unpacked the .tar.gz archive
2. run "make prometheus" (you shouldn't get errors...)
3. create /etc/prometheus/prometheus.conf (conf/prometheus.conf or sample-configuration/)
4. create /etc/prometheus/hosts (conf/prometheus.hosts or sample-configuration/)
5. to activate QoS manualy from command line, just run "./prometheus"
6. to softly shutdown QoS (and generate stats), run "./prometheus -f" ("flush")
7. to force immediate flush of QoS rules, run "./prometheus -9" ("kill")

Promethetus QoS advanced tips:

1. use -p command line switch to generate instant and safe Hall of fame preview
2. use qos-free-delay option for pause after flushing old rules/before loading new
3. take time to understand sample-configuration/ files prometheus.conf and hosts
4. note: qos-proxy-enable and qos-free-zone won't work together
5. warning: doing SNAT and QoS on the same router may cause performance problems

General Linux routing tips for beginners:

echo -n 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo -n 64000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max
echo -n 86400 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established

Prometheus Debian packages:

There are two ways to build Prometheus Debian package (*.deb)

1. as a root access and debhelper package installed, run "make deb"
2. without root access or debhelper, run "./prometheus.debian-noroot-nodebhelper"
